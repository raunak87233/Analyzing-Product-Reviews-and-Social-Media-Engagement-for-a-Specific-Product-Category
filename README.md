## 1. Introduction
With the increasing volume of products being sold online, customer reviews and social media engagement have become essential in understanding customer preferences, sentiment, and purchasing behavior. This project aims to analyze product reviews and social media engagement for a specific product category (e.g., mobile phones or laptops) across e-commerce platforms and social media sites. The focus is on understanding customer sentiment, pricing trends, and social media engagement metrics to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## 2. Objectives
The main objectives of the project are as follows:

Scrape and collect product reviews and ratings from a popular e-commerce website (e.g., Amazon or Flipkart).
Extract social media data related to the same product category from platforms like Twitter.
Analyze the data to understand price trends, customer sentiment, and the relationship between social media engagement and customer reviews.
Visualize the key findings using Power BI.
## 3. Methodology
3.1 Data Collection
E-commerce Website Scraping
A Python script was developed to scrape product reviews, ratings, prices, and review text from an e-commerce website. The following fields were extracted:

Product name
Product price
Average rating
Number of reviews
Review text (optional, scraped a few recent reviews)
Social Media Data Collection
Using the Twitter API, we extracted relevant engagement metrics for a specific product category. Data fields collected include:

Post content
Likes, retweets, comments
Hashtags used
The datasets were stored in CSV format for further analysis.

## 3.2 Data Cleaning
The datasets were cleaned to ensure accuracy and remove missing or incorrect values. The price and rating fields were converted into numeric formats for statistical analysis. Duplicate rows and missing data were removed to ensure consistency.

## 3.3 Data Analysis
The cleaned data was analyzed to identify key trends:

Price vs. Rating Trend: We explored how product prices relate to customer reviews and ratings.
Social Media Engagement: We analyzed how social media metrics like likes, retweets, and hashtags correlate with the sentiment expressed in product reviews.
## 4. Results and Findings
## 4.1 E-commerce Product Reviews
From the scraped e-commerce data, we found that products within certain price ranges tended to receive higher ratings. For example, mid-priced mobile phones had better average ratings compared to lower-priced or very expensive models.

## 4.2 Social Media Engagement Metrics
From the social media data, we identified that certain product-related hashtags drove higher engagement (likes, shares, retweets). Posts with the most engaging hashtags had significantly more likes and shares.

## 4.3 Price vs. Rating Trend
Our analysis revealed a positive correlation between product prices and ratings, particularly within a specific price band. For example, products priced between $200â€“$500 had higher average ratings than those in the $500+ range.

## 4.4 Hashtags and Engagement
The most popular hashtags, such as #MobileDeals and #BestPhones2024, drove a substantial amount of engagement. Posts using these hashtags saw increased retweets, likes, and shares, showing that the choice of hashtag can significantly impact social media reach.

## 5. Power BI Dashboard
To visualize the results, we imported the cleaned datasets into Power BI and created the following visuals:

Scatter Plot of Product Price vs. Average Rating: This helped visualize the correlation between pricing and customer satisfaction.
Line Chart of Social Media Engagement Over Time: Showcased the growth in engagement (likes, shares) over a selected time period.
Bar Chart for Top Hashtags by Engagement: Displayed the most engaging hashtags and their corresponding engagement metrics.
The Power BI dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of customer sentiment and social media trends.

## 6. Conclusion and Recommendations
Key Findings:
There is a moderate positive correlation between product prices and average customer ratings, suggesting that customers generally associate higher prices with higher product quality.
Social media engagement plays a significant role in influencing customer behavior, particularly when the right hashtags are used.
Hashtag strategies are important for social media marketing. Posts that use trending or product-specific hashtags are more likely to get shared and engage a larger audience.
Recommendations:
Optimized Pricing Strategies: Businesses should consider competitive pricing within the mid-range to attract positive reviews without sacrificing quality.
Leveraging Social Media: Companies should focus on creating content around popular hashtags to drive more engagement. Furthermore, they can integrate customer reviews with social media posts to increase credibility and reach.
Customer Engagement: Focusing on customer satisfaction by addressing reviews and feedback in real-time can enhance the brand's reputation on both e-commerce platforms and social media.
